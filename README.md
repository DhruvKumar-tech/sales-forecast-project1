 # Approach & Methodology
 
Data Collection: Gathered historical sales data from various sources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values, handled outliers, and performed feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends, seasonality, and correlations.
Model Selection & Training:
Used models like Linear Regression, XGBoost, and LSTM (for time-series forecasting).
Hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Used RMSE, MAPE, and RÂ² score to compare performance.
Visualization & Dashboard: Created insights using Power BI.
